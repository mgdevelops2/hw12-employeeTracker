  ## Description
The idea here is to build a simple CMS, with a command-line UI. For those who don't know - content management systems (CMS),  are interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. We will build the command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

Think of it AS A business owner I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
 SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
